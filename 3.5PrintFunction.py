# Demonstrating how to use the print() function in Python

# Printing text
print("This is me testing how to use the print function")

# Printing text vs arithmetic
print("1+1")   # Will print the text '1+1'
print(1+1)     # Will print the result of the addition (2)
print('1+1')   # Will also print the text '1+1'

# Working with variables
a = 'Hi my name is '
b = 'Ketro Sithole '
print(a + b)   # Concatenates (joins) the two strings and prints them

# Performing arithmetic operations
a = 7
b = 2
c = a + b
print("The sum of a and b is:", c)

# Integer (floor) division
print("Integer division (a // b):", a // b)

# End of program
